Gut@@ ach : Incre@@ ased safety for pedestri@@ ans
They are not even 100 metres apart : On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorf@@ park@@ platz in Gut@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
Two sets of lights so close to one another : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error ?
Yesterday , Gut@@ acht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; At the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eck@@ ert yesterday .
The K@@ lus@@ er lights protect cycli@@ sts , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Ber@@ gle .
The system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse junction .
We have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Gru@@ b &apos; residential area .
&quot; At times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eck@@ ert .
This was also confirmed by Peter Arn@@ old from the Offen@@ burg District Office .
&quot; According to current measurements , around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gut@@ ach on the B@@ 33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arn@@ old .
Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; Here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said Arn@@ old .
A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a round@@ about was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the nar@@ ro@@ wn@@ ess of the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse jun@@ ctions .
According to Arn@@ old , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts : &quot; Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree tr@@ un@@ ks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg without kno@@ cking over the traffic light posts . &quot;
The traffic light system itself , which cost around EUR 15@@ ,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
The system is fitted with coloured LE@@ Ds , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
And they are also energy @-@ efficient : The older light systems consu@@ me around 100 Wat@@ ts , with the new ones consuming just eight .
There are three sets of lights per direction of travel .
Arn@@ old explained the technology used by the new system : It is fitted with two ra@@ dar sensors .
If the pedestrian pres@@ ses the button at the traffic lights , the top ra@@ dar sensor checks the traffic status .
If the street is clear , the pedestrian ob@@ tains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .
An additional ra@@ dar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
Of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .
Yesterday this was not the case : The light had barely turned green for pedestri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light .
For more than 30 years , Josef Win@@ kler has been writing from the heart , telling of the hard@@ ships of his childhood and youth .
The catastrop@@ hes of his Catholic village up@@ bringing - the spe@@ ech@@ less@@ ness , his tendency towards bru@@ te force and dul@@ led sexu@@ ality , the con@@ fin@@ ement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Ka@@ ern@@ ten @-@ born po@@ et .
The BÃ¼@@ chner pri@@ ze@@ winner is known primarily as a writer of pro@@ se , with theatre texts something of a r@@ arity for him .
In a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts For his performance piece , &quot; Wetter@@ leu@@ chten auf der Zun@@ gen@@ spitze &quot; ( Summer ligh@@ tn@@ ing on the tip of your tongue ) , which can now be seen in Garage X on Pe@@ ter@@ splatz , Ger@@ hard Fres@@ acher , creates a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts .
The theatre producer has thus combined elements from the auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally inspired novel &quot; Der Lei@@ bei@@ gene &quot; ( 1987 ) &#91; The Bon@@ d@@ sman &#93; featuring pro@@ se mini@@ atures from &quot; Lei@@ chn@@ am , seine Familie bel@@ au@@ ern@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; Cor@@ pse , stal@@ king his family &#93; .
On the predomin@@ antly empty stage - with one important requirement : a cru@@ m@@ pled sofa , on which cast members all@@ ude to cop@@ ul@@ ating and ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating - the eight @-@ person ens@@ emble work their way through the text material .
However , Director Fres@@ acher seems to have little trust in the text .
The 70 @-@ minute performance g@@ losses over the script with a host of director &apos;s addi@@ tions , well @-@ known from the re@@ pertoire of post @-@ dramatic theat@@ rical styles .
In particular , the act@@ resses play a major role in the sometimes rather dubi@@ ous st@@ aging .
They are man@@ handled , their heads held under water , t@@ ack@@ ed to the wall by their evening go@@ wns .
W@@ ra@@ pped in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or in gir@@ d@@ les , they st@@ um@@ ble on danger@@ ously high he@@ els across the set , either delivering mon@@ olo@@ gues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage .
However , the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery .
The best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Pur@@ ple to traditional folk songs .
Only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see f@@ las@@ hes of Win@@ kler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of hum@@ our .
A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to mend a cru@@ mb@@ ling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureau@@ crats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to over@@ hau@@ l the out@@ dated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually d@@ ull arena of highway planning has suddenly spa@@ wn@@ ed intense debate and color@@ ful alli@@ ances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lob@@ b@@ ying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is ag@@ hast .
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n@@ . of Govern@@ ments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
Car@@ s get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one p@@ enny when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay @-@ by @-@ mile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mile@@ age @-@ based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appe@@ als to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be rig@@ ged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ ges@@ tion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they dev@@ ise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Rep@@ . Bill Sh@@ u@@ ster ( R @-@ P@@ a . ) , chairman of the House Transpor@@ tation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
The free mark@@ ete@@ ers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adri@@ an Mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transpor@@ tation sec@@ ret@@ aries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay @-@ per @-@ mile direction .
The U.S. Sen@@ ate approved a $ 90 @-@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve log@@ ging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most e@@ ager is O@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mile@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Il@@ lin@@ ois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
And the I @-@ 95 Co@@ alition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ aboard ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ inia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Conc@@ ern@@ s about Big Bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din Kh@@ an , who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transpor@@ tation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got underway , the AC@@ L@@ U of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full @-@ fle@@ dged tracking devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
Nevada is among several states now scra@@ mb@@ ling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Kh@@ an said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California star@@ tu@@ p called True Mi@@ le@@ age .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mile@@ age .
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway plann@@ ers because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , up@@ loaded periodi@@ cally by mo@@ dem .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ry@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of True Mi@@ le@@ age .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
In O@@ reg@@ on , plann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a war@@ y public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real @-@ time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; Motor@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation plann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant di@@ stra@@ ction .
