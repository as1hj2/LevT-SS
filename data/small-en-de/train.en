&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has ti@@ ghter integration with Photoshop ® and Illu@@ str@@ ator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( S@@ WF ) and Adobe Dre@@ am@@ we@@ a@@ ver ® .
Here , you &apos;ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
You &apos;ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to un@@ lock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop &apos;s P@@ SD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we &apos;ll explain when you should use the P@@ SD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
For example , you may have multiple layers in your P@@ SD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
If you use P@@ SD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate T@@ IF@@ F for each publication .
Another question that might tip you in favor of P@@ SD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports P@@ SD channels , it &apos;s simpler and more flexible .
Br@@ ing@@ ing the P@@ SD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Fin@@ der or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
To access the special features of P@@ SD , open the P@@ SD Import palette . ( Win@@ dow &gt; P@@ SD Import ) You &apos;ll instantly see thumb@@ n@@ ails of the layers along with their names .
For example , you &apos;ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an anti@@ qu@@ ed look , but when you put it in your layout it seems sw@@ amp@@ ed by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the op@@ acity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new op@@ acity level .
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to var@@ nis@@ h part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re map any channel right in the P@@ SD Import palette - non destruc@@ tively .
So click on the channels divi@@ der of the P@@ SD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project &apos;s color palette , ensuring consistency .
As powerful as the P@@ SD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can &apos;t manip@@ ulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g .
If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won &apos;t get access to the layer controls of the P@@ SD Import palette .
If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your P@@ SD by conver@@ ting the layer effects to stand @-@ alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including op@@ acity and b@@ lending mode controls .
Illu@@ str@@ ator is a great tool for creating logos and v@@ ector illu@@ strations .
Tradi@@ tionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an E@@ PS from Illu@@ str@@ ator .
Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illu@@ str@@ ator .@@ ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
Simply drag and drop or import your Illu@@ str@@ ator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn &apos;t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .@@ ai files yet .
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illu@@ str@@ ator and plan to place that over a non @-@ white background or object , you might see un@@ desirable results .
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illu@@ str@@ ator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the op@@ acity of your .@@ ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardis@@ ed many of our graphics tools to work more like Illu@@ str@@ ator , Fre@@ eh@@ and and similar tools .

Bar@@ bec@@ ue and M@@ ate Te@@ a are Argent@@ inian in@@ ven@@ tions with a social function .
Many Argent@@ inian families have in their own gri@@ ll in the back@@ yard of their homes ( called par@@ ri@@ llas ) , where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives .
The beef here has different cuts to that of Europe .
The &quot; baby bi@@ fe &quot; is approximately 1 / 2@@ kg of ste@@ ak , which could n@@ our@@ ish a whole family .
The &quot; bi@@ fe de ch@@ oriz@@ o &quot; is a gigan@@ tic rum@@ p ste@@ ak , the &quot; bi@@ fe de l@@ omo &quot; a fi@@ let .
&quot; As@@ ado de ti@@ ra &quot; is the part of the ri@@ bs , the &quot; bi@@ fe de co@@ sti@@ lla &quot; is a T @-@ bone Ste@@ ak , the &quot; mat@@ am@@ bre &quot; is a very thin cut piece of meat with lots of fat .
Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare , mid rare , done , well done etc .
The sau@@ ce which comes with the meat dish is called &quot; ch@@ im@@ ich@@ ur@@ ri . &quot; However , because of the excellent taste of the meat , it can well be e@@ aten without sau@@ ce .
A full plate of mixed gri@@ ll contains practically all animal inn@@ ards from various animals .
The S@@ aus@@ age ( ch@@ oriz@@ o ) and the black pu@@ d@@ ding ( mor@@ c@@ illa ) are very popular .
Ser@@ ved with the me@@ ats are vegetables ( sweet pot@@ atoes , p@@ ump@@ kin pu@@ ree ) and mixed sal@@ ads .
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of me@@ ats .
Depending on the season and region , it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as de@@ er , lam@@ b , sheep , go@@ at , fish , and other seaf@@ ood .
Special delic@@ acies are : king pra@@ wns ( cent@@ oll@@ a ) from Tier@@ ra de Fu@@ ego and wild bo@@ ar ( j@@ ab@@ al@@ í ) or tro@@ ut in B@@ ari@@ lo@@ che .
Special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; past@@ el de cho@@ cl@@ o &quot; or the &quot; hum@@ ita . &quot;
More typical are chi@@ cken &quot; poll@@ o &quot; in its most varied prepar@@ tions , &quot; mil@@ an@@ esa &quot; ( Vi@@ enn@@ ese escal@@ ope ) , &quot; emp@@ an@@ a@@ das &quot; ( fried pa@@ stry sh@@ ells filled with ch@@ opp@@ ed beef , chi@@ cken , ma@@ ize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; ch@@ ori@@ pan &quot; similar to a Hot Do@@ g .
Many Italian restaurants are found here which serve p@@ izza and past@@ a .
Next to fresh fruit sal@@ ads and good ice cream , a wide range of des@@ ser@@ ts are offered .
Two Argent@@ ine specialities are the &quot; dul@@ ce de le@@ che , &quot; milk @-@ car@@ am@@ el mar@@ mal@@ ade which is also used to as a bread spread and the &quot; al@@ fa@@ jo@@ res &quot; ( small cake @-@ formed bis@@ cu@@ its with different f@@ ill@@ ings ) .

This section holds the most general questions about PHP : what it is and what it does .
Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time ?
What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4 ?
What are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5 ?
I think I found a bug ! Who should I tell ?
Much of its syn@@ tax is borro@@ wed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP @-@ specific features thrown in .
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynam@@ ically generated pages quickly .
This conf@@ uses many people because the first word of the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m is the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m .
This type of ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m is called a recur@@ sive ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m .
For more information , the curious can visit &quot; Free On @-@ Line Di@@ c@@ tionary of Comp@@ uting or the &quot; Wikipedia entry on recur@@ sive ac@@ ron@@ y@@ ms .
PHP / FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP .
PHP 3 is the successor to PHP / FI 2.0 and is a lot nic@@ er .
PHP 5 is the current generation of PHP , which uses the &quot; Zend engine 2 which , among other things , offers many additional O@@ OP features .
Please see the &quot; What &apos;s new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more .
While PHP 5 was pur@@ pos@@ ely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions , there are some significant changes .
For more detailed information , please view the section on Mig@@ rating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Back@@ wards In@@ compatible Chan@@ ges .
You should go to the PHP Bug Dat@@ ab@@ ase and make sure the bug isn &apos;t a known bug .
If you don &apos;t see it in the database , use the reporting form to report the bug .
It is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug .

Note : Note that J@@ PC and JP@@ 2 are capable of having components with different bit dep@@ ths .
In this case , the value for &quot; bits &quot; is the highest bit depth encountered .
Also , JP@@ 2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 co@@ de@@ streams .
In this case , ge@@ ti@@ ma@@ ge@@ size ( ) returns the values for the first co@@ de@@ stream it en@@ counters in the root of the file .
Note : The information about icons are retri@@ ev@@ ed from the icon with the highest bit@@ rate .
It can reference a local file or ( configuration per@@ mitting ) a remote file using one of the supported streams .
This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information from the image file .
Currently , this will return the different JP@@ G AP@@ P mark@@ ers as an associ@@ ative array .
Some programs use these AP@@ P mark@@ ers to emb@@ ed text information in images .
A very common one is to emb@@ ed &quot; IP@@ TC information in the AP@@ P@@ 13 mark@@ er .
You can use the i@@ pt@@ c@@ par@@ se ( ) function to par@@ se the binary AP@@ P@@ 13 mark@@ er into something read@@ able .
Retur@@ ns an array with 7 elements .
Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image .
Note : Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images .
In these cases , ge@@ ti@@ ma@@ ge@@ size ( ) might not be able to properly determine the image si@@ z@@ e. ge@@ ti@@ ma@@ ge@@ size ( ) will return zero for width and height in these cases .
Index 2 is one of the IM@@ AG@@ ET@@ Y@@ PE _ XX@@ X con@@ stants indicating the type of the image .
Index 3 is a text string with the correct height = &quot; y@@ y@@ y &quot; width = &quot; x@@ xx &quot; string that can be used directly in an IM@@ G tag .
channels will be 3 for R@@ GB pictures and 4 for CM@@ Y@@ K pictures .
Support for J@@ PC , JP@@ 2 , JP@@ X , J@@ B@@ 2 , X@@ B@@ M , and W@@ BM@@ P became available .
Note : This function does not require the GD image library .

For the last few years the European Patent Office ( EP@@ O ) has , contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing law , granted more than 30@@ 000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general @-@ purpose comp@@ uting equipment , called &quot; programs for computers &quot; in the law of 1973 and &quot; computer @-@ implemented in@@ ven@@ tions &quot; in EP@@ O New@@ speak since 2000 .
Europe &apos;s patent movement is pressing to legitimate this prac@@ tise by writing a new law .
Although the patent movement has lost major batt@@ les in November 2000 and September 2003 , Europe &apos;s program@@ mers and citizens are still facing considerable risks .

You can read the announcement here ( pdf ) , or get the complete FAQ here , but I wanted to give you some more background on why Kin@@ do and My@@ Heritage have te@@ amed up .
The first time we met Gil@@ ad , the founder and CEO of My@@ heritage , was in early 2007 - a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kin@@ do .
G@@ are@@ th and me were invited to have lunch with him in S@@ oh@@ o in central London , and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the &quot; enemy . &quot;
This proved to be pretty nai@@ ve , since Gil@@ ad is much too nice to be called an &quot; enemy . &quot;
But there we were : A Swe@@ de , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives .
I didn &apos;t expect this , but we found that we had much in common .
We shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar .
Kin@@ do had set out to build a site that would help you inter@@ act with the family that is around you here and now .
We were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now .
My@@ Heritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family &apos;s history , and had spent years perf@@ ecting these technologies .
Ul@@ timately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together .
As G@@ are@@ th and I trav@@ elled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as My@@ Heritage already had .
What really got us exc@@ ited was their Smart@@ Mat@@ ching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too .
During this summer , we &apos;ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kin@@ do , and what the best option would be for taking Kin@@ do to the next level .
The more time we spent with Gil@@ ad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud roo@@ ster that runs around in their camp@@ us ) , the more convinced we all became - we &apos;ll be better off together .
So we join the My@@ Heritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together - bringing real benefits to families around the world .
This is what we &apos;re planning to do over the next years .
As you see from the sm@@ iles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Put@@ ney Off@@ ices .
This years Swedish Gene@@ alog@@ y Days the y@@ early conference of the Swedish Federation of Gene@@ alo@@ gical Soci@@ eties was held in the city of Malm@@ ö in the province of Sk@@ å@@ ne in southern Sweden .
Over 100 exi@@ bit@@ ors crow@@ ded in the convention center at Europa@@ por@@ ten in Malm@@ ö . Everything from gene@@ alo@@ gical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online .
In the mean@@ while , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend &apos;s family re@@ union .
Update : Now everything is fixed ! It was the database acting a bit wei@@ rd but Stephen has done a great job to fix it .
Everyone h@@ its a bri@@ ck wall in gene@@ alog@@ y , where the birth and death records just aren &apos;t easy to find . In that case , try some different records .
De@@ eds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inher@@ ited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . Histor@@ ic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co @-@ ownership .
Just as the squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s and different kinds of birds collect nu@@ ts and seeds , someone in the Kin@@ do office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning .
Ju@@ dging from this picture - it &apos;s going to be a loo@@ ong winter .
As I point out in my book , Gene@@ alog@@ y Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Bo@@ ol@@ ean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and par@@ enth@@ eses . ) Recently , Yahoo !
Advanced Google still accepts the most popular Bo@@ ol@@ ean terms , and Ex@@ al@@ ead even supports the NE@@ AR operator , which really helps with common sur@@ names , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Bo@@ ol@@ ean support .
For more details on how to do the Bo@@ ol@@ ean Boo@@ g@@ ie for gene@@ alog@@ y , read Gene@@ alog@@ y Online 8th Edition .
Most beginners to gene@@ alog@@ y are fu@@ zz@@ y about c@@ ous@@ in@@ ship . For example , while many understand first c@@ ous@@ ins are people with common grand@@ parents , many fol@@ ks conf@@ use first cou@@ sin once removed and second cou@@ sin .
Then , there are families like mine : My mother &apos;s si@@ bl@@ ings were born from 19@@ 11 to 19@@ 32 . That means her young@@ est brother &quot; Mike &quot; went to school with the oldest sister &apos;s oldest child , his ni@@ ece &quot; Kar@@ en . &quot;
As it turned out , Un@@ cle &quot; Mike &quot; and ni@@ ece &quot; Kar@@ en &quot; married two people who were si@@ bl@@ ings , &quot; Mich@@ elle &quot; and &quot; K@@ ev@@ in , &quot; making their children both first c@@ ous@@ ins and first c@@ ous@@ ins once removed .
&quot; Using DNA is one of the newest and latest tools of trac@@ ing your gene@@ alog@@ y , and it &apos;s remarkable , &quot; said Well@@ s , who represented Family Tre@@ e DNA . &quot; You can see if they mig@@ rated , you can find out more about your great @-@ a@@ unt and maybe she acted stran@@ gely , but that was because she had a baby die at child@@ birth ... you just never know what secre@@ ts the past will reveal , &quot; Well@@ s said .
-@@ First it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancest@@ ors , it is more a tool to prove lin@@ e@@ age .
Several companies , like Family Tre@@ e DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone .
- It &apos;s less re@@ ff@@ ective for fem@@ ales to use DNA than for m@@ ales because thanks to Y @-@ DNA , we can determine pat@@ ern@@ al and mat@@ ern@@ al lines , whereas for fem@@ ales it is just mat@@ ern@@ al .
Here are a few suggestions to get you started : In@@ tro@@ duction to Gene@@ alog@@ y from National Gene@@ alo@@ gical Society ( U.S. ) Most gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ sts take this course first .

Lufthansa ow@@ es its origins to &quot; Deutsche Luft H@@ ansa Aktien@@ gesellschaft &quot; ( ren@@ amed &quot; Lufthansa &quot; in 1933 ) , which is formed from a mer@@ ger between &quot; Deutsche A@@ ero Lloyd &quot; ( D@@ AL ) and &quot; J@@ unk@@ ers Luftverkehr &quot; on January 6 .
The new airline inher@@ its its c@@ rane logo , designed by &quot; Deutsche Luft @-@ Re@@ eder@@ ei &quot; in 19@@ 19 , from D@@ AL , the blue @-@ and @-@ yellow house colours from J@@ unk@@ ers .
It comm@@ ences scheduled flights on April 6 with a fleet of 16@@ 2 aircraft , of 18 different types .
A flying expe@@ dition to China is the event of the year .
Following its acquisition of shares in 19@@ 26 in the German @-@ Russian &quot; Der@@ el@@ u@@ ft &quot; airline , which was founded in 19@@ 21 , Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iber@@ ia , the Brazilian &quot; Syn@@ dic@@ ato Con@@ dor &quot; and the Chinese &quot; Eu@@ ra@@ sia &quot; airlines .
Lufthansa opens the first trans @-@ o@@ ce@@ an@@ ic , scheduled air@@ mail service across the South Atlantic .
Between 19@@ 36 and 19@@ 38 , it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic .
After substantial expansion of the route network in 1939 including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chile war@@ time air services , except for a few European countries , are suspended .
All flights are dis@@ continued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into recei@@ ver@@ ship and is finally wo@@ und up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965 .
Lufthansa enters the jet age , initially on long @-@ hau@@ l routes , with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 7@@ 07 .
The last of the prop@@ eller @-@ driven aircraft , a Vi@@ ckers Vis@@ count , is reti@@ red in 1971 .
Con@@ version to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium @-@ hau@@ l routes with the Boeing 7@@ 27 and , on short @-@ hau@@ l , with the Boeing 7@@ 37 , the city jet largely fa@@ ther@@ ed by Lufthansa .
The wide @-@ body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o jet in 1970 , later to be joined by the Mc@@ Donn@@ ell @-@ Dou@@ glas D@@ C@@ 10 and the A@@ 300 , the first of the j@@ ets from the newly founded European air@@ cra@@ ft@@ maker .
Lufthansa resu@@ mes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany &apos;s re@@ unification .
Lufthansa masters its worst @-@ ever economic crisis with a swe@@ eping rehabilitation programme .
The airline , largely owned by the state , is privati@@ sed step by step .
Its M@@ RO , cargo and IT businesses are sp@@ un off as independent companies .
Lufthansa , Air Canada , S@@ AS , Thai Airways und United Airlines create the &quot; Star Alliance , &quot; the world &apos;s first multilateral airline group@@ ing , later to be joined by other carriers .
The Lufthansa Aviation Group equi@@ ps itself for the new mill@@ eni@@ um , training its focus on innovation and quality .
Pl@@ ac@@ ement of orders for 15 Airbus A3@@ 80 me@@ gal@@ iners charts the airline &apos;s path into the future .
Even during times of crisis in the aviation industry , Lufthansa remains on the as@@ cent : With the &quot; Future European Oper@@ ations &quot; programme , the airline re@@ organis@@ es its regional markets , while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers enjoy greater comfort in a completely rev@@ amp@@ ed Business Class with fast broadband Internet connec@@ tivity in the aircraft cabin .
Lufthansa creates new perspectives for Germany &apos;s future as a business location : Lufthansa orders 20 Boeing 7@@ 47 @-@ 8@@ s and is the launch customer for the aircraft .
Pre@@ par@@ ations for the A3@@ 80 include route pro@@ ving with Airbus , a new A3@@ 80 maintenance han@@ gar and a new terminal area in Frankfurt .
The Lufthansa Aviation Center becomes an architectural flag@@ ship .

There is finally an official answer to the question of whether or not WordPress themes must &quot; inher@@ it &quot; the G@@ PL license that WordPress itself uses .
Mat@@ t asked the Software Freedom Law Center to examine the WordPress source and how themes fit in . The final , official answer to whether themes must be G@@ PL ?
The WordPress Plugin Competition is the best moment of the year , plugin wise .
This year &apos;s edition is still running till the end of the month of July and as of writing , there are about 10 p@@ lugins ( with some really interesting stuff ) . Still , new p@@ lugins are released every day .
Why aren &apos;t these authors joining the competition ? Particip@@ ating in the competition is In@@ struc@@ tive : you * will * learn something .
If WordPress were a country , our Bill of Rights would be the G@@ PL because it protects our core freedoms .
We &apos;ve always done our best to keep Word@@ Pres@@ s.@@ org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress &quot; license .
There have been some questions in the community about whether the G@@ PL applies to themes like we &apos;ve always assumed .
The Official WordPress Commer@@ cial Them@@ e Direc@@ tory is now open . It is linked off the WordPress Ex@@ tend and is part of the parent theme directory set of links .
It is not as much a directory as it is a listing of sites that offer commercial G@@ PL themes .
If you aren &apos;t already following along , I highly recommend checking out the How To Create A WordPress Them@@ e tut@@ orial series by I@@ an Ste@@ wart ( Them@@ e@@ Sha@@ per@@ .com ) .

Are you one of those worried about the progress of your WordPress blog ? Do you w@@ anna know how your visitors found you and how they inter@@ act with your site ?
Well , it requires you to dri@@ ll down the site analy@@ tics to get to the bottom .

It may sound strange that some other website is tracking your performance without you having to provide anything .

Lot@@ tery remains for centuries one of the most common forms of gambling endorsed by governments worldwide .
The very first signs of this popular trend take us way back to the H@@ an Dyn@@ asty in the Far East where a Lot@@ tery was used to aid in the finance of major governmental projects , targeted mainly to gl@@ ori@@ fy the government and its people .
The game of Lot@@ tery is very strongly printed in today � s culture and even celebrated with sp@@ l@@ end@@ or as we approach the holiday season .
The biggest celebration by far takes us to our neighbor@@ ing Spain , where locals participate and enjoy Spain � s national Christmas lot@@ tery game known as � El Gord@@ o � ( The F@@ at One ) , since 18@@ 12 .
As well as being one of the oldest lot@@ teries around , the total prize pool in recent years , have sur@@ passed the 2 billion Euro mark , making it also the biggest lot@@ tery worldwide ! !
With prizes being so high , more than 100 new milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res are produced every Christmas .
� � El Gord@@ o � works differently to most lot@@ tery games played , as countless people can share one single ticket .
A whole lot@@ tery ticket ( � bil@@ le@@ te � ) costs a few thousand Euros but these tickets are split to smaller sections , each co@@ sting around 20 Euros .
This means that many , even stran@@ gers , may share a whole ticket .
The idea is quite be@@ fitting especially now , in holiday season where many people in one community share a grand prize worth millions .
Such an event can even affect the local economy .
The El Gord@@ o takes place every 2@@ 2nd of December and again on the 5th of January .
The whole drawing process takes at least three hours to complete , with the entire community tun@@ ed to the radio in sus@@ pen@@ se .
Particip@@ ation is also available through the internet , so now you don � t necessarily have to be in Spain in order to enter this grand lot@@ tery event .

The Lord war@@ ns Nephi to de@@ part into the wil@@ der@@ ness .
His jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings in the wil@@ der@@ ness , and so forth .
Leh@@ i prop@@ he@@ si@@ es of a land of liberty - His seed shall be sc@@ attered and s@@ mitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel - He ex@@ h@@ orts his sons to put on the arm@@ or of righ@@ te@@ ousness .
1 And now it came to pass that after I , Nephi , had made an end of teaching my bre@@ th@@ ren , our a father , Leh@@ i , also sp@@ ake many things unto them , and re@@ hear@@ sed unto them , how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem .
2 And he sp@@ ake unto them concerning their a re@@ bel@@ li@@ ons upon the waters , and the mer@@ cies of God in spar@@ ing their lives , that they were not s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed up in the sea .
3 And he also sp@@ ake unto them concerning the land of promise , which they had obtained - how a mer@@ ci@@ ful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should fle@@ e out of the land of Jerusalem .
4 For , behold , said he , I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e per@@ ished .
5 But , said he , not@@ with@@ standing our aff@@ lic@@ tions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c co@@ ven@@ an@@ ted with me should be a land for the inher@@ it@@ ance of my seed .
Y@@ ea , the Lord hath d co@@ ven@@ an@@ ted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord .
6 W@@ her@@ efore , I , Leh@@ i , proph@@ es@@ y according to the work@@ ings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord .
7 W@@ her@@ efore , this a land is consec@@ rated unto him whom he shall bring .
And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the comm@@ and@@ ments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wher@@ efore , they shall never be brought down into cap@@ tivity ; if so , it shall be because of ini@@ qu@@ ity ; for if ini@@ qu@@ ity shall abo@@ und c cur@@ sed shall be the land for their sa@@ kes , but unto the righ@@ te@@ ous it shall be bl@@ essed forever .
8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would over@@ run the land , that there would be no place for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
9 W@@ her@@ efore , I , Leh@@ i , have obtained a a promise , that b in@@ as@@ much as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his comm@@ and@@ ments , they shall c prosp@@ er upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves .
And if it so be that they shall d keep his comm@@ and@@ ments they shall be bl@@ essed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to mol@@ est them , nor to take away the land of their e inher@@ it@@ ance ; and they shall d@@ well safely forever .
11 Y@@ ea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their pos@@ sessions , and he will cause them to be b sc@@ attered and s@@ mitten .
12 Y@@ ea , as one generation pass@@ eth to another there shall be a bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ eds , and great visi@@ tations among them ; wher@@ efore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would he@@ ark@@ en unto my words .
13 O that ye would awa@@ ke ; awa@@ ke from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and sha@@ ke off the aw@@ ful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which b@@ ind the children of men , that they are carried away cap@@ tive down to the e@@ ternal d g@@ ulf of mis@@ ery and wo@@ e .
and arise from the dust , and hear the words of a tre@@ mb@@ ling a parent , whose li@@ mb@@ s ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from wh@@ ence no travel@@ er can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth .
15 But behold , the Lord hath a re@@ deemed my soul from hell ; I have be@@ held his b gl@@ ory , and I am en@@ cir@@ c@@ led about e@@ tern@@ ally in the c arms of his d love .
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a stat@@ utes and the jud@@ gments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxi@@ ety of my soul from the beginning .
18 Or , that a a cur@@ sing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by s@@ word , and by fam@@ ine , and are h@@ ated , and are led according to the will and cap@@ tivity of the c de@@ vil .
19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a fav@@ ored people of the Lord .
But behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righ@@ te@@ ousness forever .
20 And he hath said that : a In@@ as@@ much as ye shall keep my b comm@@ and@@ ments ye shall c prosp@@ er in the land ; but in@@ as@@ much as ye will not keep my comm@@ and@@ ments ye shall be cut off from my presence .
22 That ye may not be a cur@@ sed with a s@@ ore cur@@ sing ; and also , that ye may not inc@@ ur the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the e@@ ternal destruction of both soul and body .
23 A@@ wake , my sons ; put on the arm@@ or of a righ@@ te@@ ousness .
Sha@@ ke off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of ob@@ s@@ curi@@ ty , and arise from the dust .
24 Re@@ bel no more against your brother , whose views have been a gl@@ orious , and who hath kept the comm@@ and@@ ments from the time that we left Jerusalem ; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God , in bringing us forth into the land of promise ; for were it not for him , we must have per@@ ished with b hunger in the wil@@ der@@ ness ; nevertheless , ye sought to c take away his life ; yea , and he hath suffered much sor@@ row because of you .
25 And I exce@@ ed@@ ingly fear and tre@@ m@@ ble because of you , l@@ est he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the gl@@ ory of God , and your own e@@ ternal welfare .
26 And ye have mur@@ mu@@ red because he hath been plain unto you .
Y@@ e say that he hath used a sharp@@ ness ; ye say that he hath been an@@ gr@@ y with you ; but behold , his b sharp@@ ness was the sharp@@ ness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restra@@ in , manifest@@ ing bol@@ dly concerning your ini@@ qui@@ ties .
27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his comm@@ anding you that ye must o@@ bey .
But behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to ut@@ ter@@ ance that he could not shut it .
28 And now my son , Lam@@ an , and also L@@ em@@ uel and S@@ am , and also my sons who are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , behold , if ye will he@@ ark@@ en unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not per@@ ish .
And if ye will he@@ ark@@ en unto him I leave unto you a a bl@@ essing , yea , even my first bl@@ essing .
29 But if ye will not he@@ ark@@ en unto him I take away my a first bl@@ essing , yea , even my bl@@ essing , and it shall rest upon him .
30 And now , Z@@ or@@ am , I speak unto you : Beh@@ old , thou art the a serv@@ ant of Lab@@ an ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever .
31 W@@ her@@ efore , because thou hast been fai@@ thful thy seed shall be bl@@ essed a with his seed , that they d@@ well in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be ini@@ qu@@ ity among them , shall harm or distur@@ b their prosperity upon the face of this land forever .
32 W@@ her@@ efore , if ye shall keep the comm@@ and@@ ments of the Lord , the Lord hath consec@@ rated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son .
Rede@@ mption com@@ eth through the Holy M@@ essi@@ ah - Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progres@@ sion - Adam fell that men might be - Men are free to choose liberty and e@@ ternal life .
1 And now , Jac@@ ob , I speak unto you : Th@@ ou art my a first -@@ born in the days of my tri@@ b@@ ulation in the wil@@ der@@ ness .
And behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered aff@@ lic@@ tions and much sor@@ row , because of the ru@@ den@@ ess of thy bre@@ th@@ ren .
2 Nevertheless , Jac@@ ob , my first @-@ born in the wil@@ der@@ ness , thou kno@@ west the great@@ ness of God ; and he shall consec@@ rate th@@ ine a aff@@ lic@@ tions for thy gain .
3 W@@ her@@ efore , thy soul shall be bl@@ essed , and thou sh@@ alt d@@ well safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God .
W@@ her@@ efore , I know that thou art re@@ deemed , because of the righ@@ te@@ ousness of thy Rede@@ em@@ er ; for thou hast b be@@ held that in the c fulness of time he com@@ eth to bring sal@@ vation unto men .
4 And thou hast a be@@ held in thy youth his gl@@ ory ; wher@@ efore , thou art bl@@ essed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the fl@@ esh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever .
And the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b sal@@ vation is c free .
5 And men are instruc@@ ted sufficiently that they a know good from evil .
And the b law is given unto men .
And by the law no fl@@ esh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off .
Y@@ ea , by the tempor@@ al law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they per@@ ish from that which is good , and become mis@@ er@@ able forever .
6 W@@ her@@ efore , a re@@ de@@ mption com@@ eth in and through the b Holy c M@@ essi@@ ah ; for he is full of d grace and truth .
7 Beh@@ old , he offer@@ eth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contri@@ te spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered .
8 W@@ her@@ efore , how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth , that they may know that there is no fl@@ esh that can d@@ well in the presence of God , a save it be through the merits , and mer@@ cy , and grace of the Holy M@@ essi@@ ah , who b lay@@ eth down his life according to the fl@@ esh , and tak@@ eth it again by the power of the Spirit , that he may bring to pass the c res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead , being the first that should rise .
9 W@@ her@@ efore , he is the fir@@ st@@ fruits unto God , in@@ as@@ much as he shall make a inter@@ c@@ ession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved .
10 And because of the inter@@ c@@ ession for a all , all men come unto God ; wher@@ efore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c hol@@ iness which is in him .
11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things .
If not so , my first @-@ born in the wil@@ der@@ ness , righ@@ te@@ ousness could not be brought to pass , neither wick@@ ed@@ ness , neither hol@@ iness nor mis@@ ery , neither good nor bad .
W@@ her@@ efore , all things must needs be a compo@@ und in one ; wher@@ efore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incor@@ ruption , happiness nor mis@@ ery , neither sense nor in@@ sen@@ sibility .
12 W@@ her@@ efore , it must needs have been created for a thing of nau@@ ght ; wher@@ efore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation .
W@@ her@@ efore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his e@@ ternal purposes , and also the power , and the mer@@ cy , and the b justice of God .
13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin .
If ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righ@@ te@@ ousness .
And if there be no righ@@ te@@ ousness there be no happiness .
And if there be no righ@@ te@@ ousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor mis@@ ery .
And if these things are not b there is no God .
And if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wher@@ efore , all things must have van@@ ished away .
14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heav@@ ens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon .
15 And to bring about his e@@ ternal a purposes in the end of man , after he had b created our first parents , and the be@@ asts of the field and the c fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and in fine , all things which are created , it must needs be that there was an opposition ; even the d forbidden e fruit in f opposition to the g tree of life ; the one being sweet and the other bitter .
16 W@@ her@@ efore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself .
W@@ her@@ efore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c entic@@ ed by the one or the other .
17 And I , Leh@@ i , according to the things which I have read , must needs sup@@ pose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heav@@ en ; wher@@ efore , he became a c de@@ vil , having sought that which was evil before God .
18 And because he had fallen from heav@@ en , and had become mis@@ er@@ able forever , he a sought also the mis@@ ery of all mankind .
W@@ her@@ efore , he said unto E@@ ve , yea , even that old ser@@ p@@ ent , who is the de@@ vil , who is the father of all b lies , wher@@ efore he said : Par@@ take of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil .
19 And after Adam and E@@ ve had a par@@ taken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth .
20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth .
21 And the days of the children of a men were pro@@ lon@@ ged , according to the b will of God , that they might c rep@@ ent while in the fl@@ esh ; wher@@ efore , their state became a state of d prob@@ ation , and their time was leng@@ th@@ ened , according to the comm@@ and@@ ments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men .
For he gave comm@@ and@@ ment that all men must rep@@ ent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the trans@@ gres@@ sion of their parents .
22 And now , behold , if Adam had not trans@@ gres@@ sed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden .
And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end .
23 And they would have had no a children ; wher@@ efore they would have remained in a state of inno@@ c@@ ence , having no b joy , for they knew no mis@@ ery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin .
24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a kno@@ w@@ eth all things .
25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy .
26 And the a M@@ essi@@ ah com@@ eth in the fulness of time , that he may b re@@ de@@ em the children of men from the fall .
And because that they are c re@@ deemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the comm@@ and@@ ments which God hath given .
27 W@@ her@@ efore , men are a free according to the b fl@@ esh ; and c all things are d given them which are expe@@ dient unto man .
And they are free to e choose f liberty and e@@ ternal g life , through the great Medi@@ ator of all men , or to choose cap@@ tivity and death , according to the cap@@ tivity and power of the de@@ vil ; for he seek@@ eth that all men might be h mis@@ er@@ able like unto himself .
29 And not choose e@@ ternal death , according to the will of the fl@@ esh and the a evil which is ther@@ ein , which gi@@ v@@ eth the spirit of the de@@ vil power to b cap@@ tiv@@ ate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may re@@ ign over you in his own kingdom .
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my prob@@ ation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the proph@@ et .
And I have none other object save it be the ever@@ lasting a welfare of your sou@@ ls .
The Go@@ ds finish their planning of the creation of all things - They bring to pass the creation according to their plans - Adam names every living creature .
1 And thus we will finish the heav@@ ens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them .
2 And the Go@@ ds said among themselves : On the sevent@@ h time we will end our work , which we have coun@@ sel@@ ed ; and we will a rest on the b sevent@@ h time from all our work which we have coun@@ sel@@ ed .
3 And the Go@@ ds concluded upon the sevent@@ h time , because that on the sevent@@ h time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Go@@ ds ) coun@@ sel@@ ed among themselves to form ; and c san@@ c@@ ti@@ fied it .
And thus were their decisions at the time that they coun@@ sel@@ ed among themselves to form the heav@@ ens and the earth .
5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every her@@ b of the field before it grew ; for the Go@@ ds had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they coun@@ sel@@ ed to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground .
6 But there went up a m@@ ist from the earth , and water@@ ed the whole face of the ground .
7 And the a Go@@ ds formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man &apos;s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breath@@ ed into his no@@ stri@@ ls the breath of life , and man became a living d soul .
8 And the Go@@ ds plan@@ ted a garden , e@@ ast@@ ward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed .
9 And out of the ground made the Go@@ ds to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from th@@ ence it was par@@ ted and became into four heads .
11 And the Go@@ ds took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it .
13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou sh@@ alt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou e@@ at@@ est thereof , thou sh@@ alt surely die .
Now I , Abra@@ ham , saw that it was after the Lord &apos;s a time , which was after the time of b K@@ olo@@ b ; for as yet the Go@@ ds had not appointed unto Adam his reck@@ oning .
14 And the Go@@ ds said : Let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him .
16 And of the ri@@ b which the Go@@ ds had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man .
18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cle@@ ave unto his wife , and they shall be b one fl@@ esh .
19 And they were both n@@ aked , the man and his wife , and were not a ash@@ amed .
20 And out of the ground the Go@@ ds formed every be@@ ast of the field , and every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof .
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , to every be@@ ast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him .
Men are called as high pri@@ ests because of their exce@@ eding faith and good works - They are to teach the comm@@ and@@ ments - Through righ@@ te@@ ousness they are san@@ c@@ ti@@ fied and enter into the rest of the Lord - Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k was one of these - Angel@@ s are declar@@ ing glad ti@@ dings throughout the land - They will reveal the actual coming of Christ .
1 And again , my bre@@ th@@ ren , I would c@@ ite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these comm@@ and@@ ments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a or@@ da@@ ined pri@@ ests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people .
2 And those pri@@ ests were or@@ da@@ ined after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for re@@ de@@ mption .
3 And this is the manner after which they were or@@ da@@ ined - being a called and b prepared from the c foundation of the world according to the d fore@@ knowledge of God , on account of their exce@@ eding faith and good works ; in the first place being left to e choose good or evil ; therefore they having chosen good , and exerc@@ ising exce@@ ed@@ ingly great f faith , are g called with a holy calling , yea , with that holy calling which was prepared with , and according to , a preparatory re@@ de@@ mption for such .
4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the har@@ dness of their hearts and b blin@@ dness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their bre@@ th@@ ren .
9 Thus they become a high pri@@ ests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Beg@@ otten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth .
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a san@@ c@@ ti@@ fied , and their b gar@@ ments were wash@@ ed white through the blood of the Lam@@ b .
12 Now they , after being a san@@ c@@ ti@@ fied by the b Holy G@@ host , having their gar@@ ments made white , being c pure and spo@@ tless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e ab@@ hor@@ rence ; and there were many , exce@@ ed@@ ingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God .
13 And now , my bre@@ th@@ ren , I would that ye should hum@@ ble y@@ ourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for rep@@ ent@@ ance , that ye may also enter into that rest .
14 Y@@ ea , hum@@ ble y@@ ourselves even as the people in the days of a Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k , who was also a high pri@@ est after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood forever .
15 And it was this same Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k to whom Abra@@ ham paid a ti@@ thes ; yea , even our father Abra@@ ham paid ti@@ thes of one @-@ t@@ enth part of all he poss@@ essed .
16 Now these a ordin@@ ances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a re@@ mission of their s@@ ins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord .
18 But Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k having exercised mi@@ ghty faith , and received the office of the high pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood according to the a holy order of God , did pre@@ ach rep@@ ent@@ ance unto his people .
And behold , they did rep@@ ent ; and Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the pr@@ ince of peace , for he was the king of Sal@@ em ; and he did re@@ ign under his father .
19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention .
20 Now I need not re@@ hear@@ se the matter ; what I have said may suff@@ ice .
Beh@@ old , the a scri@@ p@@ tures are before you ; if ye will b w@@ rest them it shall be to your own destruction .
22 Y@@ ea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angel@@ s , d@@ oth declare it unto all nations ; yea , d@@ oth declare it , that they may have glad ti@@ dings of great joy ; yea , and he d@@ oth sound these glad ti@@ dings among all his people , yea , even to them that are sc@@ attered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wher@@ efore they have come unto us .
23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot er@@ r ; and this because of our being b wander@@ ers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly fav@@ ored , for we have these glad ti@@ dings declared unto us in all parts of our vine@@ yard .
24 For behold , a angel@@ s are declar@@ ing it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his gl@@ ory .
25 And now we only wait to hear the jo@@ y@@ ful news declared unto us by the mouth of angel@@ s , of his coming ; for the time com@@ eth , we a know not how soon .
Would to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will re@@ jo@@ ice .
26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angel@@ s , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of proph@@ ec@@ y which was in them .

1 @-@ 3 , Christ has all power ; 4 @-@ 5 , All men must rep@@ ent or suffer ; 6 @-@ 12 , E@@ ternal punishment is God &apos;s punishment ; 13 @-@ 20 , Christ suffered for all , that they might not suffer if they would rep@@ ent ; 21 @-@ 28 , Pre@@ ach the go@@ sp@@ el of rep@@ ent@@ ance ; 29 @-@ 41 , Dec@@ l@@ are glad ti@@ dings .
1 I am a Alpha and O@@ me@@ ga , b Christ the Lord ; yea , even I am he , the beginning and the end , the Rede@@ em@@ er of the c world .
3 Ret@@ a@@ ining all a power , even to the b destroying of Sat@@ an and his works at the c end of the world , and the last great day of judgment , which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof , d jud@@ ging every man according to his e works and the de@@ eds which he hath done .
4 And surely every man must a rep@@ ent or b suffer , for I , God , am c endless .
5 W@@ her@@ efore , I a re@@ vo@@ ke not the jud@@ gments which I shall pass , but wo@@ es shall go forth , we@@ eping , b wa@@ iling and gn@@ ash@@ ing of teeth , yea , to those who are found on my c left hand .
6 Nevertheless , it is a not written that there shall be no end to this tor@@ ment , but it is written b endless c tor@@ ment .
7 Again , it is written a e@@ ternal dam@@ nation ; wher@@ efore it is more express than other scri@@ p@@ tures , that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men , altogether for my name &apos;s gl@@ ory .
8 W@@ her@@ efore , I will explain unto you this a myst@@ ery , for it is meet unto you to know even as mine a@@ post@@ les .
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing , even as one , that you may enter into my a rest .
10 For , behold , the a myst@@ ery of go@@ d@@ liness , how great is it !
For , behold , I am b endless , and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless c punishment , for d End@@ less is my name .
11 a E@@ ternal punishment is God &apos;s punishment .
15 Therefore I command you to rep@@ ent - rep@@ ent , l@@ est I a s@@ mit@@ e you by the ro@@ d of my mouth , and by my wr@@ ath , and by my anger , and your b suff@@ er@@ ings be s@@ ore - how s@@ ore you know not , how exquisite you know not , yea , how hard to bear you know not .
19 Nevertheless , gl@@ ory be to the Father , and I par@@ took and a finished my preparations unto the children of men .
20 W@@ her@@ efore , I command you again to rep@@ ent , l@@ est I a hum@@ ble you with my al@@ mi@@ ghty power ; and that you b conf@@ ess your s@@ ins , l@@ est you suffer these c pun@@ ish@@ ments of which I have spoken , of which in the smallest , yea , even in the least degree you have d ta@@ sted at the time I with@@ drew my Spirit .
21 And I command you that you a pre@@ ach nau@@ ght but rep@@ ent@@ ance , and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me .
22 For they cannot a bear meat now , but b milk they must receive ; wher@@ efore , they must not know these things , l@@ est they per@@ ish .
23 a Learn of me , and listen to my words ; b walk in the c me@@ ek@@ ness of my Spirit , and you shall have d peace in me .
24 I am Jesus Christ ; I a came by the b will of the Father , and I do his will .
25 And again , I command the@@ e that thou sh@@ alt not a co@@ v@@ et thy b neighb@@ or &quot; s c wife ; nor seek thy neighb@@ or &apos;s life .
27 Which is my word to the a G@@ enti@@ le , that soon it may go to the b Je@@ w , of whom the Laman@@ ites are a c rem@@ n@@ ant , that they may believe the go@@ sp@@ el , and look not for a d M@@ essi@@ ah to come who has already come .
28 And again , I command the@@ e that thou sh@@ alt a pra@@ y b vo@@ cally as well as in thy heart ; yea , before the world as well as in secret , in public as well as in private .
29 And thou sh@@ alt a declare glad ti@@ dings , yea , b publish it upon the mountains , and upon every high place , and among every people that thou sh@@ alt be permitted to see .
30 And thou sh@@ alt do it with all humili@@ ty , a tru@@ sting in me , b revi@@ ling not against re@@ vil@@ ers .
31 And of a ten@@ ets thou sh@@ alt not talk , but thou sh@@ alt declare rep@@ ent@@ ance and b faith on the Sa@@ vi@@ or , and c re@@ mission of s@@ ins by d b@@ ap@@ tism , and by e fire , yea , even the f Holy G@@ host .
32 Beh@@ old , this is a great and the last a comm@@ and@@ ment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter ; for this shall suff@@ ice for thy daily walk , even unto the end of thy life .
33 And mis@@ ery thou sh@@ alt receive if thou wi@@ lt slight these a coun@@ sels , yea , even the destruction of thy@@ self and property .
34 a Im@@ part a portion of thy property , yea , even part of thy lands , and all save the support of thy b family .
35 Pay the a debt thou hast b contrac@@ ted with the printer .
Release thy@@ self from c bon@@ da@@ ge .
37 And a speak freely to all ; yea , pre@@ ach , ex@@ h@@ ort , declare the b truth , even with a loud voice , with a sound of re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , cr@@ ying - Ho@@ s@@ anna , ho@@ s@@ anna , bl@@ essed be the name of the Lord God !
38 a Pra@@ y always , and I will b p@@ our out my Spirit upon you , and great shall be your bl@@ essing - yea , even more than if you should obtain c treas@@ ures of earth and cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ b@@ len@@ ess to the extent thereof .
39 Beh@@ old , can@@ st thou read this without a re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing and lifting up thy heart for b gla@@ dness ?
40 Or can@@ st thou run about longer as a a blind guide ?
41 Or can@@ st thou be a hum@@ ble and me@@ ek , and conduct thy@@ self wis@@ ely before me ?
Re@@ vel@@ ation given to Joseph Smith the Prop@@ het and Si@@ dney R@@ ig@@ don , at or near Fa@@ y@@ ette , New York , December 18@@ 30 . HC 1 : 128 @-@ 13@@ 1 .
At this time the Prop@@ het was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bi@@ ble .
The translation was begun as early as June 18@@ 30 , and both Oliver Co@@ w@@ der@@ y and John Whit@@ mer had served as scri@@ bes .
Since they had now been called to other duties , Si@@ dney R@@ ig@@ don was called by di@@ vine appointment to serve as the Prop@@ het &apos;s scri@@ be in this work ( verse 20 ) .
As a pre@@ face to his record of this re@@ vel@@ ation the Prop@@ het wrote : &quot; In December Si@@ dney R@@ ig@@ don came &#91; from O@@ hi@@ o &#93; to in@@ qu@@ ire of the Lord , and with him came Ed@@ ward Par@@ tri@@ dge . .

1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and O@@ me@@ ga , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d e@@ ternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever .
2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a cru@@ ci@@ fied for the s@@ ins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one .
3 Beh@@ old , ver@@ ily , ver@@ ily , I say unto my serv@@ ant Si@@ dney , I have looked upon the@@ e and thy works .
I have a heard thy pra@@ yers , and prepared the@@ e for a greater work .
4 Th@@ ou art bl@@ essed , for thou sh@@ alt do great things .
Beh@@ old thou w@@ ast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Eli@@ j@@ ah which should come , and thou k@@ newest it not .
6 But now I give unto the@@ e a comm@@ and@@ ment , that thou sh@@ alt a b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze by water , and they shall receive the b Holy G@@ host by the laying on of the c hands , even as the a@@ post@@ les of old .
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a G@@ enti@@ les , for their b fol@@ ly and their ab@@ om@@ inations shall be made mani@@ fest in the eyes of all people .
8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shor@@ tened ; and I will show b mi@@ ra@@ cles , c signs , and wonder@@ s , unto all those who d believe on my name .
9 And wh@@ o@@ so shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devi@@ ls ; they shall he@@ al the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the dea@@ f to hear , and the dum@@ b to speak , and the l@@ ame to walk .
11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b des@@ ol@@ ations upon c Bab@@ yl@@ on , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her e for@@ nic@@ ation .
12 And there are a none that do@@ eth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my go@@ sp@@ el , which I have sent forth unto this generation .
14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shi@@ eld and their bu@@ ck@@ ler ; and I will gir@@ d up their lo@@ ins , and they shall fight man@@ fully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d s@@ word in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indi@@ gn@@ ation will I preserve them .
16 And they shall learn the par@@ able of the a fi@@ g -@@ tree , for even now already summer is n@@ ig@@ h .
18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the myst@@ ery of those things which have been b se@@ aled , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d ab@@ ide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead .
19 W@@ her@@ efore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Com@@ for@@ ter , the b Holy G@@ host , that kno@@ w@@ eth all things .
21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c as@@ le@@ ep , and shall d ab@@ ide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f p@@ uri@@ fied , even as I am pure .
22 And now I say unto you , a tar@@ ry with him , and he shall journey with you ; for@@ sake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled .
23 And a in@@ as@@ much as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to proph@@ es@@ y ; and thou sh@@ alt pre@@ ach my go@@ sp@@ el and call on c the holy proph@@ ets to prove his words , as they shall be given him .
25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be con@@ founded at all .
26 a Li@@ ft up your hearts and be glad , your b re@@ de@@ mption draw@@ eth n@@ ig@@ h .
27 Fe@@ ar not , little a flo@@ ck , the b kingdom is yours until I come .

On their return trip to Kir@@ t@@ land the Prop@@ het and ten el@@ ders had travel@@ ed down the Miss@@ our@@ i River in can@@ oes .
On the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced .
El@@ der William W. P@@ helps , in day@@ light vision , saw the destro@@ yer riding in power upon the face of the waters .
1 @-@ 12 , The Lord has decre@@ ed many destruc@@ tions upon the waters ; 13 @-@ 22 , The waters were cur@@ sed by John , and the destro@@ yer ri@@ de@@ th upon their face ; 23 @-@ 29 , Some have power to command the waters ; 30 @-@ 35 , El@@ ders are to journey two by two and pre@@ ach the go@@ sp@@ el ; 36 @-@ 39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man .
1 Beh@@ old , and he@@ ark@@ en unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from ever@@ lasting to ever@@ lasting , even b Alpha and O@@ me@@ ga , the beginning and the end .
3 But ver@@ ily I say unto you , that it is not need@@ ful for this whole company of mine el@@ ders to be moving swiftly upon the waters , whilst the inhabitants on either side are per@@ ishing in un@@ belief .
5 For I , the Lord , have decre@@ ed in mine anger many destruc@@ tions upon the waters ; yea , and especially upon these waters .
6 Nevertheless , all fl@@ esh is in mine hand , and he that is fai@@ thful among you shall not a per@@ ish by the waters .
7 W@@ her@@ efore , it is expe@@ dient that my serv@@ ant Si@@ dney Gil@@ bert and my serv@@ ant a William W. P@@ helps be in ha@@ ste upon their err@@ and and mission .
9 But now , ver@@ ily I say , it be@@ ho@@ ov@@ eth me that ye should part .
10 And in@@ as@@ much as they are a fai@@ thful they shall be preserved , and I , the Lord , will be b with them .
11 And let the resi@@ due take that which is need@@ ful for clothing .
12 Let my serv@@ ant Si@@ dney Gil@@ bert take that which is not need@@ ful with him , as you shall agree .
13 And now , behold , for your a good I gave unto you a b comm@@ and@@ ment concerning these things ; and I , the Lord , will reason with you as with men in days of old .
14 Beh@@ old , I , the Lord , in the beginning bl@@ essed the a waters ; but in the last days , by the mouth of my serv@@ ant John , I b cur@@ sed the waters .
15 W@@ her@@ efore , the days will come that no fl@@ esh shall be safe upon the waters .
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Z@@ ion upon the waters , but he that is u@@ pri@@ ght in heart .
17 And , as I , the Lord , in the beginning a cur@@ sed the land , even so in the last days have I b bl@@ essed it , in its time , for the use of my sa@@ ints , that they may par@@ take the fat@@ ness thereof .
19 I , the Lord , have decre@@ ed , and the destro@@ yer ri@@ de@@ th upon the face thereof , and I re@@ vo@@ ke not the decre@@ e .
20 I , the Lord , was a an@@ gr@@ y with you yesterday , but today mine anger is turned away .
21 W@@ her@@ efore , let those concerning whom I have spoken , that should take their journey in ha@@ ste - again I say unto you , let them take their journey in ha@@ ste .
22 And it mat@@ ter@@ eth not unto me , after a little , if it so be that they fill their mission , whether they go by water or by land ; let this be as it is made known unto them a according to their jud@@ gments here@@ after .
23 And now , concerning my servants , Si@@ dney R@@ ig@@ don , Joseph Smith , Jun@@ . , and Oliver Co@@ w@@ der@@ y , let them come not again upon the waters , save it be upon the can@@ al , while jour@@ ne@@ ying unto their homes ; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey , save upon the can@@ al .
25 And they shall do a like unto the children of Israel , b pit@@ ching their t@@ ents by the way .
26 And , behold , this comm@@ and@@ ment you shall give unto all your bre@@ th@@ ren .
28 W@@ her@@ efore , let him do as the Spirit of the living God comm@@ an@@ de@@ th him , whether upon the land or upon the waters , as it remain@@ eth with me to do here@@ after .
29 And unto you is given the course for the sa@@ ints , or the way for the sa@@ ints of the camp of the Lord , to journey .
31 And in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that people , yea , unto him whose anger is a kin@@ d@@ led against their wick@@ ed@@ ness , a people who are well @-@ n@@ ig@@ h b ri@@ pen@@ ed for destruction .
32 And from th@@ ence let them journey for the con@@ greg@@ ations of their bre@@ th@@ ren , for their lab@@ ors even now are wanted more abund@@ antly among them than among the con@@ greg@@ ations of the wick@@ ed .
34 And in@@ as@@ much as they do this they shall a rid their gar@@ ments , and they shall be spo@@ tless before me .
35 And let them journey together , or a two by two , as seem@@ eth them good , only let my serv@@ ant Re@@ yn@@ olds C@@ ah@@ o@@ on , and my serv@@ ant Sam@@ uel H. Smith , with whom I am well pleased , be not separated until they return to their homes , and this for a wise purpose in me .
37 And in@@ as@@ much as you have hum@@ b@@ led y@@ ourselves before me , the bl@@ ess@@ ings of the a kingdom are yours .
38 Gir@@ d up your lo@@ ins and be a wat@@ ch@@ ful and be so@@ ber , looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man , for he com@@ eth in an hour you think not .
39 Pra@@ y always that you enter not into a temp@@ tation , that you may ab@@ ide the day of his coming , whether in life or in death .
Re@@ vel@@ ation given through Joseph Smith the Prop@@ het , at Hi@@ ra@@ m , O@@ hi@@ o , November 18@@ 31 , at the request of Or@@ son Hyde , Lu@@ ke S. John@@ son , Ly@@ man E. John@@ son , and William E. Mc@@ L@@ el@@ lin . HC 1 : 2@@ 27 @-@ 2@@ 29 .
Although this re@@ vel@@ ation was given in response to supp@@ lication that the mind of the Lord be made known concerning the el@@ ders named , much of the content per@@ tains to the whole Church .
1 My serv@@ ant , Or@@ son Hyde , was called by his ordin@@ ation to proc@@ la@@ im the a ever@@ lasting go@@ sp@@ el , by the b Spirit of the living God , from people to people , and from land to land , in the c con@@ greg@@ ations of the wick@@ ed , in their d syn@@ ago@@ gues , reason@@ ing with and e ex@@ po@@ und@@ ing all scri@@ p@@ tures unto them .
3 And this is the a ens@@ ample unto them , that they shall b speak as they are moved upon by the Holy G@@ host .
4 And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the a Holy G@@ host shall be scri@@ p@@ ture , shall be the will of the Lord , shall be the mind of the Lord , shall be the word of the Lord , shall be the voice of the Lord , and the b power of God unto sal@@ vation .
5 Beh@@ old , this is the promise of the Lord unto you , O ye my servants .
6 W@@ her@@ efore , be of good a che@@ er , and do not b fear , for I the Lord am with you , and will stand by you ; and ye shall bear record of me , even Jesus Christ , that I am the Son of the living God , that I c was , that I am , and that I am to come .
8 a Go ye into all the world , b pre@@ ach the go@@ sp@@ el to every c creature , acting in the d authority which I have given you , e b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ing in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy G@@ host .
9 And a he that belie@@ v@@ eth and is b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed shall be saved , and he that belie@@ v@@ eth not shall be b dam@@ ned .
10 And he that belie@@ v@@ eth shall be bl@@ est with a signs following , even as it is written .
12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record , to you shall be given power to a seal them up unto e@@ ternal life .
15 W@@ her@@ efore they shall be a high pri@@ ests who are worthy , and they shall be appointed by the b First Presidency of the Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k Pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood , except they be liter@@ al desc@@ end@@ ants of c Aar@@ on .
17 For the fir@@ st@@ born holds the right of the presidency over this pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood , and the a keys or authority of the same .
18 No man has a legal right to this office , to hold the keys of this pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood , except he be a a liter@@ al desc@@ end@@ ant and the fir@@ st@@ born of Aar@@ on .
19 But , as a a high pri@@ est of the Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k Pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood has authority to offici@@ ate in all the lesser offices he may offici@@ ate in the office of b bis@@ hop when no liter@@ al desc@@ end@@ ant of Aar@@ on can be found , provided he is called and set apart and or@@ da@@ ined unto this power , under the hands of the First Presidency of the Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k Pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood .
20 And a liter@@ al desc@@ end@@ ant of Aar@@ on , also , must be designated by this Presidency , and found worthy , and a ano@@ in@@ ted , and or@@ da@@ ined under the hands of this Presidency , otherwise they are not legally authorized to offici@@ ate in their pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood .
21 But , by virtue of the decre@@ e concerning their right of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood desc@@ ending from father to son , they may claim their a ano@@ in@@ ting if at any time they can prove their lin@@ e@@ age , or do as@@ certain it by re@@ vel@@ ation from the Lord under the b hands of the above named Presidency .
24 And if he rep@@ ent he shall be a for@@ given , according to the co@@ ven@@ ants and b comm@@ and@@ ments of the church .
25 And again , in@@ as@@ much as a parents have children in Z@@ ion , or in any of her b st@@ akes which are organized , that c teach them not to understand the d doctr@@ ine of rep@@ ent@@ ance , faith in Christ the Son of the living God , and of b@@ ap@@ tism and the gift of the Holy G@@ host by the laying on of the hands , when e eight years old , the f sin be upon the heads of the parents .
26 For this shall be a law unto the a inhabitants of Z@@ ion , or in any of her st@@ akes which are organized .
27 And their children shall be a b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed for the b re@@ mission of their s@@ ins when c eight years old , and receive the laying on of the hands .
28 And they shall also a teach their children to pra@@ y , and to walk u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly before the Lord .
29 And the inhabitants of Z@@ ion shall also observe the a Sab@@ bath day to keep it holy .
30 And the inhabitants of Z@@ ion also shall remember their a lab@@ ors , in@@ as@@ much as they are appointed to labor , in all fai@@ th@@ fulness ; for the b id@@ ler shall be had in rem@@ embran@@ ce before the Lord .
31 Now , I , the Lord , am not well a pleased with the inhabitants of Z@@ ion , for there are b id@@ lers among them ; and their c children are also growing up in d wick@@ ed@@ ness ; they also e seek not ear@@ ne@@ stly the rich@@ es of e@@ tern@@ ity , but their eyes are full of f gre@@ ed@@ iness .
32 These things ought not to be , and must be done away from among them ; wher@@ efore , let my serv@@ ant Oliver Co@@ w@@ der@@ y a carry these sa@@ y@@ ings unto the land of Z@@ ion .
33 And a comm@@ and@@ ment I give unto them - that he that ob@@ serv@@ eth not his a pra@@ yers before the Lord in the season thereof , let him be had in b rem@@ embran@@ ce before the judge of my people .
34 These sa@@ y@@ ings are a true and fai@@ thful ; wher@@ efore , trans@@ gress them not , neither b take there@@ from .
35 Beh@@ old , I am a Alpha and O@@ me@@ ga , and I b come quickly .

5 Q@@ . What are we to understand by the four and twenty a el@@ ders , spoken of by John ?
